# Parking System
A parking system that revolutionizes the way users can park their vehicles at a lot.

# Use Case
Have you ever been to a parking lot, but you had to scurry around the entire lot just to try to find parking? With this program, you will be able to view all parking slots, a captured image of the license plates, the recognized license plate string, and view the status of the slot. When a car leaves a slot, the website is immediately pinged with information about the slot, and you, the user, will be able to discover which parking slots are available.
